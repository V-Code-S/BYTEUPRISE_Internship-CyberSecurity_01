# Password Complexity Checker
The goal of this project is to create a Python-based tool that evaluates the strength of a user's password based on various complexity criteria. This tool will provide instant feedback to the user regarding the robustness of their password, suggesting improvements to enhance security.

## Explanation of the Project
A Password Complexity Checker assesses the strength of a password by evaluating it against several criteria. 
These criteria typically include:

### Length: The password should have a minimum and maximum length.
### Uppercase Letters: The password should contain at least one uppercase letter.
### Lowercase Letters: The password should contain at least one lowercase letter.
### Numbers: The password should contain at least one digit.
### Special Characters: The password should contain at least one special character (e.g., @, #, $, etc.).
### Spaces: The password should not contain any spaces.

## Key Components of the Project
### Password Validation:
Checking each of the above criteria.
Providing feedback to the user about which criteria are met and which are not.

### User Interface (Optional):
A graphical interface to input the password and display feedback.
