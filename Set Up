# Explanation of the Code
## Password Validation:

The password_complexity_checker function takes a password as input and evaluates it against the defined criteria.
It returns the strength of the password (as a percentage) and feedback on each criterion.
User Interface (Optional):

The tkinter library is used to create a simple GUI.
The check_password function is called when the user clicks the "Check Password" button. It displays the strength and feedback using a message box.
Running the Code
Without GUI:

Save the non-GUI code to a file (e.g., password_checker.py) and run it using:
python cyber1.py

This setup provides a simple yet effective tool for users to check and improve their password strength, enhancing their overall digital security.
